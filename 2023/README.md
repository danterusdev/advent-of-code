# Advent of Code 2023

## Stats
| Day | Part A | Part B  | Language | Comments & Ramblings |
| --- | ------ | ------  | -------- | -------------- |
|  1  | ~5:00  | ~15:00  |    Go    | None |
|  2  |  7:45  | 10:44   |  Python  | None |
|  3  |  26:46 | 31:15   |  Python  | Killed by off-by-one errors |
|  4  |  3:29  | 21:51   |  Python  | Did not think about the algorith for pt b, luckily was saved by @cache |
|  5  | 15:54  |1:29:54  |  Python  | Killed by range math |
|  6  | 7:59   | 10:48   |  Python  | Just slow |
|  7  | 28:14  |1:09:24  |  Python  | Killed by math again, probably bad implementation too |
|  8  | 05:11  |*1:37:03 |  Python  | Used a hint to solve this one (part 2), though the hidden guarantee justifies it in my head |
|  9  | 09:28  |  11:26  |  Python  | A little slow to understand the problem, but overall very quick and easy |
| 10  | 36:37  |1:06:24  |  Python  | Small bug that cost me a bit of time in part1, part2 took a while to come up with an initial solution, but once I did, it worked first try, overall good |
| 11  | 10:57  |  28:16  |  Python  | Lost around 10 mins on part two because I confused x and y |
| 12  | 32:45  |2:05:38  |  Python  | Had no idea what to do for part 2, still don't really understand it |
| 13  | 48:46  |1:43:43  |  Python  | Definitely was not using the most simple algorithm |
| 14  | 15:51  |1:35:12  |  Python  | Pretty bad, should have put more focus into testing earlier |
| 15  | 03:19  | 21:04   |  Python  | Pretty good, however took forever to understand part2 and even when I thought I did, I didn't |
| 16  | 19:58  | 30:06   |  Python  | Relatively clean day, but made some silly mistakes for part 2 which cost me 3-4 mins |
| 17  |2:14:00 |2:43:41  |  Python  | Took forever to get the intuition to solve this problem in any way, eventually came up with a very slow solution, but it works |
| 18  | 39:30  |2:31:24  |  Python  | Just a hard problem, took a while to conceptualize a working solution |
| 19  | 21:54  | 38:49   |  Python  | My best performance yet, a little slow on the coding due to being methodical, but very clean |
| 20  | 58:07  |*11:16:59|  Python  | Had no idea how to solve part 2, turns out it was another hidden guarantee (found through looking at a solution), I really do not like those |
| 21  | 11:26  |*12:46:28|  Python  | Came up with the idea for part 2 quite quickly, however made many small mistakes in implementation |
| 22  | 21:08  | 36:55   |  Python  | My new best performance, struggled a little on part 2, just dumb mistakes, but 101st (8 seconds away from scoring my first AOC points) and 217th are my two best placements so far |
| 22  | 36:28  |2:48:26  |  Python  | Took a while to figure out part 1, and then took even longer to figure out what was needed for part 2 |

> Some timed independently because I don't always do them at release
