# Advent of Code 2023

## Stats
| Day | Part A | Part B | Language | Notes |
| --- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -------------- |
|  1  | ~5:00  | ~15:00 |    Go    | None |
|  2  |  7:45  | 10:44  |  Python  | None |
|  3  |  26:46 | 31:15  |  Python  | Killed by off-by-one errors |
|  4  |  3:29  | 21:51  |  Python  | Did not think about the algorith for pt b, luckily was saved by @cache |
|  5  | 15:54  |1:29:54 |  Python  | Killed by range math |
|  6  | 7:59   | 10:48  |  Python  | Just slow |
|  7  | 28:14  |1:09:24 |  Python  | Killed by math again, probably bad implementation too |
|  8  | 05:11  |*1:37:03|  Python  | Used a hint to solve this one (part 2), though the hidden guarantee justifies it in my head |
|  9  | 09:28  |  11:26 |  Python  | A little slow to understand the problem, but overall very quick and easy |
| 10  | 36:37  |1:06:24 |  Python  | Small bug that cost me a bit of time in part1, part2 took a while to come up with an initial solution, but once I did, it worked first try, overall good |
| 11  | 10:57  |  28:16 |  Python  | Lost around 10 mins on part two because I confused x and y |
| 12  | 32:45  |2:05:38 |  Python  | Had no idea what to do for part 2, still don't really understand it |
| 13  | 48:46  |1:43:43 |  Python  | Definitely was not using the most simple algorithm |
| 14  | 15:51  |1:35:12 |  Python  | Pretty bad, should have put more focus into testing earlier |
| 15  | 03:19  | 21:04  |  Python  | Pretty good, however took forever to understand part2 and even when I thought I did, I didn't |
| 16  | 19:58  | 30:06  |  Python  | Relatively clean day, but made some silly mistakes for part 2 which cost me 3-4 mins |
| 17  |2:14:00 |2:43:41 |  Python  | Took forever to get the intuition to solve this problem in any way, eventually came up with a very slow solution, but it works |
| 18  | 39:30  |2:31:24 |  Python  | Just a hard problem, took a while to conceptualize a working solution |

> Some timed independently because I don't always do them at release
